## Data Structures

- [Robert Tarjan: Binary Search Tree (4th HLF;Sep 23, 2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcQoCL-vvmU)

```
The binary search tree is one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science, with many applications. 
Binary search trees support binary search in a set of totally ordered items, and ideally reduce search time from linear to logarithmic.
A central question is how to keep such a tree balanced in the presence of updates.
The first solution was offered by Adelson-Velskii and Landis in 1962.
In spite of a huge volume of work during the intervening 64 years, the design space is rich, and basic questions remain open, 
notably how best to make a search tree adapt to its usage pattern. 
In this talk I will explore relatively recent new work and interesting open problems.

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Balanced BST
- AVL Tree, Weak AVL Tree, Relaxed AVL Tree
- Splay Tree
- Dynamic Optimality

## Algorithms

## Distributed Computing Theory

## Formal Methods

### From Leslie Lamport

- [Leslie Lamport: The PlusCal Algorithm Language (4th HLF Lecture)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFH_-QogN0&t=121s)

```
An algorithm is not a program, so why describe it with a programming language? 
PlusCal is a tiny toy-like language that is infinitely more expressive than any programming language 
because an expression can be any mathematical formula.
```

## Programming Languages

## Machine Learning

- [John E. Hopcroft: Exciting Computer Science Research Directions (4th HLF Lecture) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWXgUIXaFdA)

```
We have entered the information age and this has changed the nature of computer science and created many exciting research problems. 
Two of these are extracting information from large data sources and learning theory. 
This talk will focus on two problems: 
first, how to find hidden structure in social networks and second some subareas of research in deep learning.
